# The "applicationConfiguration.default.properties" file ships with
# Mifos in the WAR file and contains default configuration values that
# should not be modified by an MFI during Mifos deployment.
# To customize the values in "applicationConfiguration.default.properties",
# a separate file containing only those values to be changed should be
# created. This file containing override values must be named
# "applicationConfiguration.custom.properties"
